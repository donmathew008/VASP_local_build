# $\color{Violet}{\textbf{VASP Installation + OpenMPI +Â wannier90}}$
## We use pure MPI parallelization only even if it was build with OpenMPI
### Here we discuss building VASP with OpenMPI in a Desktop where "Installation_AOCC_AOCL" and "Installation_GCC_AOCL" are build locally and "Installation_intel_mkl" is the normal installation
### $\color{Red}{\textbf{Even though we were able to build the executables, the builds with AOCL were making errors while running}}$
### $\color{Green}{\textbf{The Installation with intel mkl is working fine along with wannier90}}$
